## Description
Matrix Multiplication and Determinant Calculator is a terminal-based program that allows a user to carry out determinant calculations and matrix multiplication. The program ensures that the dimensions of the matrix, or matrices, are compatible for either finding the determinant or matrix multiplication.

## How to Use
I recommend running this program on a Unix-like environment, as it is straightforward to run C programs in these environments. 

First, clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/rahildhodapkar/matrix-multi-det.git
```
Navigate to it:
```
cd recipe-finder
```
Compile it by running the following command in the directory:
```
make
```

If you are using Windows and do not have this command, you can refer to this [article](https://medium.com/@samsorrahman/how-to-run-a-makefile-in-windows-b4d115d7c516).

Run the program with the following command:
```
./matrix
```

From there, the terminal will output instructions for you to follow.

## Technologies Used
This program was written entirely in C, and uses a Makefile.
